## Creating Test Audio

You can create test audio using:

1. **Your phone's voice recorder**
2. **Audacity** (free audio editor)
3. **Online voice recorders**

## Sample Prompts to Record

For testing, try recording yourself saying:

**Sad scenario:**
"I've been feeling really down lately. Everything feels so heavy and I don't know what to do."

**Anxious scenario:**
"I'm so worried about everything. I can't stop thinking about what might go wrong."

**Angry scenario:**
"I'm so frustrated! Nothing seems to be working out the way I planned."

**Neutral scenario:**
"I'm just checking in. Not sure how I'm feeling today, just wanted to talk."

## Notes
- Speak naturally, as you would to a friend
- Recording length: 10-60 seconds works well
- Background noise is okay - the app handles it
